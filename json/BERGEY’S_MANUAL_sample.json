Although hydroxylated fatty acids are present in the lip-\nids of members of other genera of aerobic pseudomonads, spe-\ncies of Burkholderia are characterized by the presence of hydroxy\nfatty acids of 14, 16, and 18 carbon atoms (C14:0 3OH and C16:0,\nand C16:0 2OH, C16:1, and C18:1). The most characteristic of these\nacids is the C16:0 3OH. Two different ornithine lipids are present\nin strains of some of the species. Over one-half of the species\nare pathogenic for plants or animals (including humans).

One species, B. mallei, is nonmotile\nand lacks \ufb02agella (Redfearn et al., 1966).\n\nIntracellular granules The cells of species of the genus ac-\ncumulate granules of carbon reserve material (poly-b-hydroxy-\nbutyrate, PHB, which may be part of a copolymer with poly-b-\nhydroxyvalerate, PHA). Proteins (\u201cphasins\u201d) have been found to\nbe associated with the granules (Wieczorek et al., 1996). Only\nB. pseudomallei and some strains of B. mallei use extracellular PHB\nfor growth (Ramsay et al., 1990). All species able to accumulate\nPHB can use the intracellular polymer when needed; however,\nin the description of some species, the statement \u201ccan use PHB\u201d\nhas been included, without indicating whether the PHB was\nendo- or extracellular.\n\nThe colonies of most species of the genus are smooth, but\nthose of the human pathogen B. pseudomallei often have a rough\nsurface.\n\nLipids The \ufb01rst detailed analysis of the fatty acids of aerobic\npseudomonads, using both saprophytic and phytopathogenic\nstrains, demonstrated the possibility of establishing a correlation\nwith the phylogenetic subdivision of the genus Pseudomonas, as\nclassically de\ufb01ned, on the basis of rRNA\u2013DNA hybridization\n(Oyaizu and Komagata, 1983). Years later, the results of this sur-\nvey were con\ufb01rmed and extended (Stead, 1992). The results of\nthese investigations \ufb01rmly established the fact that members of\n\n*Editorial Note: Since submission of this manuscript, Burkholderia norimbergensis was\nreclassi\ufb01ed as Pandoraea norimbergensis by Coenye et al. (2000). Readers are advised\nto review the chapter in that genus for additional details.\n\nrRNA similarity group II of Palleroni et al. (1973), which includes\nthe genus Burkholderia, have a fatty acid composition containing\nC14:0 3OH and C16:0, and C18:1 2OH. Most strains also contained\nC16:0 2OH and C16:1. Even though hydroxylated fatty acids are pres-\nent in the lipids of members of other groups, group II including\nBurkholderia is the only one having hydroxylated fatty acids of 14,\n16, and 18 carbon atoms (Table BXII.b.1). A recent evaluation\nof the taxonomic signi\ufb01cance of fatty acid composition empha-\nsizes the diagnostic value of the above results (Vancanneyt et al.,\n1996), con\ufb01rming earlier \ufb01ndings on this approach for the char-\nacterization of major phylogenetic groups within the pseudo-\nmonads (Wollenweber and Rietschel, 1990).\n\nOrnithine-containing lipids in Pseudomonas aeruginosa, P. pu-\ntida, and B. cepacia represent from 2\u201315% of the total of extract-\nable lipids. The amino acid was not found in the phospholipids\nthat amount to more than 80% of all the extractable lipids (Kawai\net al., 1988). An analysis of the polar lipids and fatty acids of B.\ncepacia has shown that the only signi\ufb01cant phospholipids in this\nspecies are phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and bis(phosphatidyl)-\nglycerol. These characteristics, taken together with the unusual\nlipid pro\ufb01les of B. cepacia, can be used as markers of chemotax-\nonomic importance (Cox and Wilkinson, 1989a).\n\nA striking feature of the cellular composition of B. cepacia is\nthe range of polar lipids, which include two forms (with and\nwithout 2-OH fatty acids) of phosphatidyl-ethanolamine and or-\nnithine amide lipids. Variations in the lipid composition, as well\nas in pigmentation and \ufb02agellation, were observed as the con-\nsequence of changes in growth temperature and limiting oxygen,\ncarbon, phosphorus, and magnesium supplies in the medium.\nPhosphorus limitation appears to be the only nutritional factor\nthat results in a composition with polar lipids represented only\nby ornithine amide lipids (Taylor et al., 1998).\n\nInterestingly, the 3-hydroxylated fatty acid of 10 carbon atoms\nis a component of the lipids of B. gladioli but not of those of B.\ncepacia, as indicated by lipid analysis performed on B. gladioli\nstrains isolated from respiratory tract infections in cystic \ufb01brosis\npatients (Christenson et al., 1989).\n\nDifferentiation of the plant pathogenic species of Burkholderia\ncan be done by a direct colony thin-layer chromatographic\n\nTABLE BXII.b.1.

BURKHOLDERIA\n\n577\n\nmethod. Only minor uncertainties have been noticed with re-\nspect to the composition of aminolipids (Matsuyama, 1995).\n\nThe general qualitative pro\ufb01le of hydroxylated fatty acids in-\ndicated above is constant for a given species, although at least\nin one case (B. glumae) a subdivision of strains into two types is\npossible based on differences in composition. One of the sub-\ngroups, which included the type strain, had a composition that\nwas similar to the bulk of rRNA similarity group II. The other\nwas represented by strains that had signi\ufb01cant amounts of the\nC10:0 3OH fatty acid, and was unique in rRNA similarity group II\nin having the C12:0 3OH fatty acid (Stead, 1992). For some of the\ncomponents of the fatty acid pro\ufb01le, signi\ufb01cant quantitative var-\niations can be observed among the strains of different species of\nBurkholderia.\n\nIn contrast to the hydroxylated fatty acids, which have their\norigin in lipid A, the more abundant, nonhydroxylated fatty acids\nare mainly located in the cytoplasmic membrane. Their value as\ntaxonomic markers is signi\ufb01cant at the species level and less at\nthe higher level of the RNA similarity groups. All strains of group\nII have C16:0, C16:1 cis, and C18:1 cis nonhydroxylated fatty acids\n(Stead, 1992). The investigations of Komagata and his collabo-\nrators have established that Q-8 is the quinone characteristic of\ngroup II (Oyaizu and Komagata, 1983).\n\nHopanes have been detected in the composition of cells of\nB. cepacia (Rohmer et al., 1979), but the value of these com-\npounds as chemotaxonomic markers is not known because later\nstudies apparently did not include strains of other species of the\ngroup. This point perhaps warrants further attention.\n\nFlagella Motility can be observed in young cultures of strains\nof all species of Burkholderia, with the exception of B. mallei, which\nlacks \ufb02agella. Cells of the latter species do not even show twitch-\ning motility on the surface of solid media (Henrichsen, 1975a).\nMotility in liquid is due to one or, more commonly, several polar\n\ufb02agella. A single \ufb02agellum per cell has been reported for B.\nandropogonis, B. glathei, and B. norimbergensis (see descriptions in\nthe list of species at the end of this chapter). The best-known\nexample is that of B. andropogonis, whose single \ufb02agellum is\nsheathed (Fuerst and Hayward, 1969a) (Fig. BXII.b.1).\n\nSDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis has been used for the\ncharacterization of the \ufb02agellins of different species of aerobic\npseudomonads. Based on \ufb02agellin composition, B. cepacia strains\nhave been divided into two groups. Group I has \ufb02agellin of mo-\nlecular weight 31,000, whereas group II \ufb02agellin ranges from\n44,000\u201346,000. Type I was serologically uniform, while group II\nwas heterologous. The \ufb02agellin types of B. cepacia appear to be\nanalogous to the two major \ufb02agellin types of P. aeruginosa, and\nthey could be used as molecular epidemiological tools (Montie\nand Stover, 1983).\n\nThe methodology for the isolation of B. pseudomallei \ufb02agellin\nand its characterization has been described. Electrophoretic anal-\nysis under denaturing conditions results in monomer protein\nbands with an estimated Mr of 43,000 (Brett et al., 1994). O-\npolysaccharide-\ufb02agellin conjugates in this species have been de-\nscribed with respect to their structural and immunological char-\nacteristics (Brett and Woods, 1996).\n\nPili (\ufb01mbriae) Peritrichous pili have been identi\ufb01ed years\nago in B. cepacia (Fuerst and Hayward, 1969b). They are thought\nto facilitate adherence to mucosal epithelial surfaces (Kuehn et\nal., 1992; Sajjan and Forstner, 1993). Twitching motility is cor-\nrelated with the presence of polar \ufb01mbriae, a correlation that is\nsupported by the fact that this type of motility is absent from B.\n\ncepacia, which has no polar \ufb01mbriae (Henrichsen, 1975a). No\n\ufb01mbriae have been observed in B. andropogonis (Fuerst and Hay-\nward, 1969b).\n\nOne or more of \ufb01ve morphologically distinct classes of pili\ncan be present in the cells of B. cepacia. Some of the types have\nbeen identi\ufb01ed in cells of epidemically transmitted strains, and\nothers in environmental isolates (Goldstein et al., 1995; Sajjan\net al., 1995). The role of a 22-kDa pilin in binding B. cepacia to\nthe mouth epithelial cells has been described (Sajjan and Forst-\nner, 1993). Further details on \ufb01mbriae will be given in the section\non pathogenesis for humans and animals.\n\nComposition of cell envelope The earliest data on the cell\nwall composition of B. cepacia were obtained in S. Wilkinson\u2019s\nlaboratory, where it was found that the major components, myr-\nistic, 3-hydroxymyristic, and 3-hydroxypalmitic acids, were indi-\ncations that members of this group had a different composition\nthan other species of aerobic pseudomonads. These results are\nin agreement with those of fatty composition of whole cells (Sam-\nuels et al., 1973). The core polysaccharide contains glucose,\nrhamnose, and heptoses, but at most a very low phosphorus\ncontent. The lipopolysaccharide (LPS) has a low content of 3-\ndeoxy-d-manno-2-octulosonic acid (KDO), and the side chain is\nbasically a mannan. One added peculiar feature is the presence\nof an acid-labile amino sugar phosphate presumably associated\nwith the lipid A.\n\nThe results have been con\ufb01rmed, at least in part, by Manniello\net al. (1979). Analyses of B. cepacia performed by these workers\nrevealed the presence of rhamnose, glucose, heptose, and hex-\nosamine, but no KDO, and the phosphorus content was found\nto be about one-third of that of P. aeruginosa. The presence of\nKDO in the LPS of B. cepacia, however, was later con\ufb01rmed\n(Straus et al., 1990).\n\nA method of extraction of LPS from B. pseudomallei has been\ndescribed. As in the case with B. cepacia, the link between the\ninner core and lipid A is stable to acid hydrolysis (Kawahara et\nal., 1992). The LPS of clinical strains of this last species was\ncomposed of two polymers made of different repeating units, but\nboth polymers contained d-rhamnose and d-galactose residues\n(Cerantola and Montrozier, 1997).\n\nFive major outer membrane proteins have been isolated from\nseveral strains of B. pseudomallei, with Mr values ranging from\n17,000\u201370,000. One of the proteins associated with the pepti-\ndoglycan acts as a porin through which small saccharides may\ndiffuse (Gotoh et al., 1994b).\n\nOuter membrane proteins of B. cepacia and B. pseudomallei\nthat are inducible by phosphate starvation appear to be similar\nto the E. coli PhoE porin protein. The latter does not have the\nbinding sites for anions and phosphate that are present in the\nanalogous proteins from Pseudomonas species (Poole and Han-\ncock, 1986).\n\nOne porin of B. cepacia is an oligomer composed of two pro-\nteins. The puri\ufb01ed 81-kDa whole protein (OpcPO) upon heating\ngives a major 36-kDa protein (OpcP1) and a minor one (OpcP2)\nof 27 kDa. The association of these two components is nonco-\nvalent (Gotoh et al., 1994a). Recently, the major porin protein,\n(OpcP1), was partially sequenced, and the information was used\nfor cloning the gene. Its sequence showed an open reading frame\nof a length in agreement with that of OpcP1 (Tsujimoto et al.,\n1997).\n\nAdditional information about porins and other components\nof the cell envelopes may be found in the sections on antibiotic\nsusceptibility and antigenic structure.\n\n\f", "578": "578\n\nFAMILY I.

Fuerst.)\n\nPigmentation Pigmentation is by no means a universal char-\nacter of Burkholderia. Some B. cepacia strains are not pigmented,\nwhereas others produce phenazine pigments of a bewildering\nvariety of colors when grown on solid chemically de\ufb01ned media\ncontaining different carbon sources. Pigmented strains of the\nspecies can be subdivided into two types on the basis of their\npigmentation: some are yellow on glucose yeast extract peptone\nagar and others are various shades of brown, red, violet, and\npurple (Morris and Roberts, 1959). Morris and Roberts isolated\nthe pigment from a purple-pigmented strain and demonstrated\nthat its basic structure was that of a phenazine. In fact, two phen-\nazine pigments\u2014one yellow and the other purple\u2014may be syn-\nthesized, both of which are water-soluble under neutral or al-\nkaline conditions. A single strain can produce both types, only\none type, or none. Because the pigments are soluble in water,\nboth the colonies and the medium appear pigmented. Growth\non King A medium1 often enhances pigment production.\n\nIn the author\u2019s experience, pigment production in Burkholde-\nria is, as in many other cases, a striking but not very reliable\ntaxonomic character, because pigment biosynthesis often re-\nquires conditions that cannot be precisely controlled.\n\nNutrition and growth conditions The strains of Burkholderia\nspecies grow in media of minimal composition, without the ad-\ndition of organic growth factors. Occasionally, strains are isolated\nfrom nature that grow extremely slowly but are stimulated by\naddition of complex organic mixtures such as yeast extract. Some\nof the \ufb02uorescent plant pathogens of the genus Pseudomonas fall\nin this category, and the phenomenon has also been observed\nfor some B. caryophylli strains (Palleroni, 1984).\n\n1. Medium of King et al.

These studies have re-\nvealed a remarkable variety of organic compounds that can serve\nindividually as carbon and energy sources for strains of some\nspecies (B. cepacia, B. pseudomallei). The types of compounds used\nfor growth are the basis of the vast phenotypic information now\navailable for many strains (Redfearn et al., 1966; Stanier et al.,\n1966; Ballard et al., 1970). One of the simplest chemically de\ufb01ned\nmedia used for nutritional studies is the one recommended for\nthe hydrogen pseudomonads (Palleroni and Doudoroff, 1972).2\nThe nutritional investigations revealed that some strains of B.\ncepacia could utilize any of a list of 100 organic compounds (two-\nthirds of the list of tested substrates) (Stanier et al., 1966). Later\nwork performed in various laboratories has enlarged the list con-\nsiderably. This remarkable metabolic versatility of the species was\nunknown to plant pathologists, and its discovery rapidly con-\nverted B. cepacia into a fascinating subject for biochemical re-\nsearch. A sample of the nutritional properties of Burkholderia\nspecies is presented in Table BXII.b.2, and some of these prop-\nerties, together with general characteristics of taxonomic impor-\ntance, are summarized in Table BXII.b.3. Comparisons of nutri-\ntional properties of some related species are also to be found in\nlater sections (Tables BXII.b.5 and BXII.b.7). To the remarkable\nmetabolic versatility of B. cepacia we have to add the ability to \ufb01x\nN2 that is exhibited by some of the strains (Bevivino et al., 1994;\n\n2.
